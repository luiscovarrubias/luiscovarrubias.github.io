Beginning work on nicer ePortfolio website  

# Idea: Create a new ePortfolio website to replace existing one.

# Inspiration: https://slaughterbootlegs.com/
- When I first saw this website, I knew this was what I would base my new portfolio on.  
- Very clear and easy to see end goal of making my projects and information easy to access and look good too

# What do I want to add that didn't exist before?  
- Newly accquired C++ and Python knowledge  
- Adding the projects I've done for each of these languages and keeping it as up to date as possible
- Present Swift apps in a nicer and easier to read way
- Reference to older portfolio website in HTML section
- Update *About Me* page and keep up to date
- *Ideally* not blind people who look at it
