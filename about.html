              Hello, my name is Luis Covarrubias, I'm 21 years old, and I was born and raised in Houston, Texas.<br><br>
		
              From a young age I just knew I loved technology. From interacting with my first video game console to using my first computer, I knew I had to discover everything technology was capable of. This passion and curiosity motivated me to learn the ins-and-outs of every device or program I encountered. I wanted to understand how my computer worked, and this knowledge even allowed me to build my own computer. I also went on to learn how to navigate simple menus and settings that at first glance look intimidating to the average person. This easily led me to being the designated "tech" person within my household. Every issue my family presented me with, I would make sure I could provide a helpful solution no matter how difficult the problem was. I feel that this drive for solving any problem is what makes me the person I am today. When I had questions about technology, I resorted to sifting through numerous manuals, videos, and guides. Therefore, when the opportunity arises, I always strive to help others in any way I can with the knowledge I have gained. I hope one day I am able to take my knowledge to the next level by continually growing my skill set and teaching others based on my own experiences.<br><br>
              
              I have been drawn to the programming field for many years mainly because of the Computer Science classes I took throughout my high school years and, more specifically, my computer science teacher who encouraged me to learn more about the field. It was from taking these classes that I have learned to code in many languages, as seen on my main projects page, and strengthen my skills as a problem solver. In school, I learned many core programming concepts that I would utilize in all of my work. Outside of school, I worked on many projects, varying in both effort and time, that have further strengthened my knowledge and understanding of the programming languages I know today.<br><br>
              
              Making this website was a lot of fun, not just because I could show off some of my HTML and CSS knowledge, but because I now can show anyone what I enjoy to do in an easily digestible format. This website will continue to update as I expand my knowledge and skills in the field of programming. Please contact me with any questions or comments!
